12. Web Development with Rust

Using Web Frameworks like Rocket or Actix:
Rust has several web frameworks to choose from. Rocket and Actix are popular choices for building web applications.
 
// Example Rocket web application
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, Rust!"
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/", routes![index])
}


Building RESTful APIs:
Rust is well-suited for building RESTful APIs. You can use libraries like serde-json for JSON serialization and Rocket for routing.

Frontend Integration with WebAssembly:
Rust can also be used for frontend web development by compiling to WebAssembly (Wasm). The wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack tools facilitate this process.
