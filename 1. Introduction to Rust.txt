1. Introduction to Rust

History and Background of Rust:
Rust was created by Mozilla and first released in 2010. It was designed to address issues like memory safety, data races, and null pointer dereferences that often lead to security vulnerabilities and crashes in other programming languages. Rust's primary goal is to provide a safe and concurrent alternative to C and C++ while still being efficient.

Key Features and Design Goals:

Memory Safety: Rust enforces strict rules at compile time to prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows.
Concurrency: Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming, making it easier to write safe and efficient multi-threaded code.
Zero-Cost Abstractions: Rust allows high-level programming constructs without sacrificing performance.
Ownership System: The ownership system ensures memory safety by tracking ownership and lifetimes of data.
Installing Rust and Setting Up the Development Environment:
To get started with Rust, you need to install it and set up your development environment. You can download Rust from the official website (https://www.rust-lang.org/). Once Rust is installed, you can use the rustc compiler to compile Rust programs.

Here's a basic "Hello, World!" example in Rust:

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
