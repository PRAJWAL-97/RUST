9. Standard Library and Crates

Exploring Rust's Standard Library:
Rust comes with a powerful standard library that provides common data structures and functionality. It includes collections like Vec, HashMap, and modules for I/O, networking, and more.
 
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from("Alice"), 42);
    scores.insert(String::from("Bob"), 36);

    for (name, score) in &scores {
        println!("{}: {}", name, score);
    }
}

Using External Crates from crates.io:
Rust has a package manager called Cargo, which makes it easy to add external libraries (crates) to your project. You can find crates on crates.io.
