13. Systems Programming with Rust

Interfacing with C Libraries:
Rust provides FFI (Foreign Function Interface) for interfacing with C libraries. You can use the extern keyword to declare C functions and use them in Rust code.
 
extern "C" {
    fn printf(format: *const u8, ...) -> i32;
}

fn main() {
    let format = b"Hello, %s\n\0" as *const u8;
    let name = b"Rust\0" as *const u8;
    unsafe {
        printf(format, name);
    }
}


Low-Level System Programming:
Rust is suitable for low-level system programming, including writing operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems.

Building Command-Line Tools:
Rust is a great choice for building command-line tools. Libraries like clap make it easy to create user-friendly command-line interfaces.
